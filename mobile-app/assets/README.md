# Assets Directory

This directory contains the app assets:

- icon.png - App icon (1024x1024)
- splash.png - Splash screen image
- adaptive-icon.png - Android adaptive icon
- favicon.png - Web favicon

For development, you can use placeholder images or generate them using:
- https://www.appicon.co/ for app icons
- https://www.figma.com/ for custom designs
- Or use Expo's asset generation tools

The current app will work without these assets, but you'll see warnings in the console.
