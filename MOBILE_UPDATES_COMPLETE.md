4. **`mobile-app/src/screens/main/AISuggestionsScreen.tsx`** - AI suggestions screen

## New Data Structure

The mobile app now works with the new outfit structure:

```typescript
interface Outfit {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  category: string;
  price_range: string;
  brand: string;
  google_link: string;
  fit_advice: string;
  styling_tip: string;
  suggestionId: string;
  userId: string;
}
```

## API Integration

The mobile app now uses the updated backend endpoints:
- `POST /suggestions/generate` - Generate outfit suggestions
- `GET /suggestions/history` - Get user's suggestion history
- `GET /suggestions/:id` - Get detailed suggestion with outfits
- `POST /suggestions/:id/feedback` - Submit feedback

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: Direct outfit data from AI
2. **Enhanced UX**: Fit advice and styling tips provide more value
3. **Better Performance**: Fewer API calls, simpler data processing
4. **Direct Shopping**: Google links for immediate purchases
5. **Mobile-Optimized**: Touch-friendly interface
6. **Consistent Experience**: Matches web frontend functionality

## Ready for Testing

The mobile app is now ready to work with the updated backend. All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the app should compile successfully.

## Next Steps

1. Test the mobile app with the updated backend
2. Verify outfit generation and display works correctly
3. Test shopping links functionality
4. Validate responsive design on different devices
5. Test error handling and edge cases

The mobile app now provides a seamless experience for users to generate AI outfit suggestions with fit advice, styling tips, and direct shopping links! üéâ
